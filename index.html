                        The Barbershop is a no-frills Beer and Wine bar located in historic Downtown Dripping Springs,
                        Tx. Our main focus revolves around Texas Craft Beer, but we carry options for all. Established
                        in 2009, The Barbershop has become a favorite for locals to enjoy great beer and make new
                        friends. We host live music almost every Tuesday, and host a Pickers Circle every Sunday, for
                        anyone who wants to get in on the action.

                        Old timers chuckle at calling this building “the old barber shop,” but that’s what it was for
                        the past quarter century. Our building started its life around November 1924 as a wooden and tin
                        garage. In 1938, when it was owned by D.W. Crenshaw, it was given its rock exterior. The
                        building served as a garage and gas station until around 1960. After that, it was not used
                        commercially for most of the next 25 years when it was then remodeled and turned into a barber
                        shop. As a point of interest, in 1937, Crenshaw and a mechanic who worked for him, James
                        Farrell, bought the lot across the street from the then garage to build a movie theater. While
                        it had its fits and starts, it was actually used as a movie theater for a bit. That is now the
                        Wells Fargo building. For a truly detailed history of Dripping Springs, read The Complete
                        History of Dripping Springs, Texas and the P.A. Smith Survey by Carl Waits.
